            <h5 class="mx-auto text-center  border-2 border-black p-4">ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. Trained on a vast corpus of text data using unsupervised learning techniques, allowing it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of prompts and questions. As a language model, the main purpose is to generate text that is coherent, informative, and relevant to the input he receives.</h5>
